# Best Article Matching
**March 2025**  
**Nazanin Mohammadzadeh**

## 1. Project Overview
This project aims to build an intelligent system that helps users find the most relevant articles based on their queries. The system works by storing article data in a database and generating embeddings for each article's content using the Gemini text-embedding-004 model. These embeddings are then stored in Qdrant for efficient similarity search. When a user submits a query, the system retrieves and ranks the most similar articles based on their query's embedding.

**Key Features:**

- Matches multiple articles based on a given query.

- Displays article content alongside the matched results for better context.

- Provides an interface that is easy to use and integrates seamlessly with other systems.

## 2. Technology Stack
This project leverages the following libraries and frameworks:

- Python: 3.11.9
- Streamlit: 1.42.2(for building the web interface)
- Flask: 3.1.0 (for backend operations)
- Qdrant: 1.13.2
- SQLAlchemy: 2.0.38
- PaydanticAI: 0.0.26
- FastAPI: 0.115.11

## 3.Data Loading

- **Author**
- **Title** 
- **Content**
The articles are loaded into the system and preprocessed to facilitate the extraction of meaningful information for analysis and matching.

## 4. Model Development
### 4.1 Text Similarity Model

- A Text Vectorization model is used to represent each article's content numerically by generating embeddings.
- **Gemini text-embedding-004:** The system utilizes the Gemini text-embedding-004 model for text embedding generation. This model transforms the content of each article into a 768-dimensional vector.
- **Cosine Similarity:** The core of the matching process. Cosine similarity measures the similarity between the query's vector and the article's vector, providing a score that indicates how relevant each article is to the user's query.

### 4.2 Ranking and Retrieval

- Based on the similarity scores generated by cosine similarity, articles are ranked in descending order of relevance.
- The top N most relevant articles are retrieved and displayed to the user, ensuring that the articles are aligned with the context of the user's query.


## 5. Web Interface Development

### 5.1 FastAPI Interface

- FastAPI is used to create a fast and efficient backend for processing user queries and handling API requests.
- **Query Input:** Users can send queries to an API endpoint via HTTP requests.
- **Results Display:** Once the query is processed, the system returns the most relevant articles based on cosine similarity, displaying the article title and content.
- **Multiple Articles:** The FastAPI backend ranks articles by relevance and retrieves the top matches for the user query.

### 5.2 Streamlit Front-End

- Streamlit is used for the user interface, providing a simple and interactive way for users to enter their query and view results.
- **User-Friendly Display:** The Streamlit interface lets users easily input their queries and see the most relevant articles displayed with their titles and content.
- **Dynamic Interaction:** As users input new queries, the frontend dynamically updates to show the best matching articles retrieved from the FastAPI backend.

### 5.3 FastAPI Backend and Streamlit Integration

- The FastAPI backend serves as the processing engine that interacts with Qdrant for embedding storage and retrieval.
- Streamlit communicates with FastAPI, sending user queries and displaying the results returned by the backend.
- The system provides a seamless experience where the FastAPI backend handles data processing, and Streamlit offers an intuitive, real-time user interface for       interacting with the system.

## 6. How to Use

- Step 1: Clone the Repository
`git clone <repository-url>`
- Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory
`cd your-repository-name`
- Step 3: Install Dependencies
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Step 4: Run the Application
Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the FastAPI server and Streamlit interface.
### For FastAPI (Backend):
`uvicorn api:app --reload`
### For Streamlit (Frontend):
`streamlit run streamlit_interface.py`
- Step 6: Access the Application

FastAPI should now be running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (or whichever port is specified).
Streamlit should be running on http://localhost:8501 for the interactive interface.
